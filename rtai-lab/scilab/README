This directory contains the support for modifing the Scilab/Scicos code 
generation, so that it can be used within RTAI user space soft/hard real time
and monitered with RTAI-Lab.

Please refer to the "scilab-howto" manual which contains a detailed description
about installing RTAI, RTAI-LAb and the Scilab/Scicos addons.

Old RTAI Scicos block diagrams are no more supported with the new approach implemented in this new release. I'm sorry for this (little) problem. Old RTAI-Lib blocks must simply be substituted with the new ones!

The user can now implement his own "template makefile" under "<scilab_dir>/macros/RTAI/RT_templates. The new scicos menu "Set Target"  allows to link a template makefile to a scicos block diagram. The name of the "target" is the same as the template makefile (rtai.mak -> rtai).

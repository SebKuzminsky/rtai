These are RTAI own patches but they can be used also as any of their standard 
ADEOS counterpart, the opposite being not true.

FOR COMEDI USERS (what follows may be obsolete now, kept just in case):
patches for 2.4.32/2.6.13/2.6.14 do not contain a config parameter that is 
understood by COMEDI.
In order to allow using the most recent patches with COMEDI here is a suggestion
from Roberto Bucher <roberto.bucher@supsi.ch>:

"in order to compile the COMEDI drivers for RTAI-3.3, the user must simply add 
the line:
 
CONFIG_RTHAL=y

to the .config file in the kernel directory. This should solve temporarily the 
problem.

The COMEDI "configure" file is looking for "CONFIG_RTHAL" or "CONFIG_ADEOS" in 
the ".config" kernel file."

Note also that Andreas Leuner <al14@inf.tu-dresden.de> has pointed out that
the most recent snapshots of COMEDI CVS do care of using the latest patches
(IPIPEd) natively. To such an aim he suggests that those not wanting to 
modify .config in Linux should use what found in COMEDI CVS newer than
2005-12-14.

Paolo.

****** SWITCHES EXAMPLE ******

This directory checks task switching time by repeated use of suspend/resumes
and semaphore signal/waits. In case you are slicing microsecs note that the
results are related to a relativily heavily loaded task queues, i.e. 30 tasks,
both for the semaphore waiting and suspended tasks lists. Moreover they 
include full FPU support.
This example can be executed by using either a kernel space only scheduler 
(UP/SMP/MUP) or the integrated kernel/user space scheduler (LXRT). In the latter
case you'll have a chance of verifying also the difference between using RTAI
proper kernel tasks and Linux kernel threads, by toggling the macro
USE_RTAI_TASKS in user/sched.c.
